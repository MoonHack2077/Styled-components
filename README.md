# Weather api

<p>
    In this project I did the challenge of <a href='https://devchallenges.io/' >devchallenges</a> , for that I used the weather api from <a href='https://www.metaweather.com/api/' >metaweather</a>. Plus, i seized it to begin to apply the styled-components library in my projects
</p>

### **To use this project:**
First:
if you have ssh-key:
## `git clone git@github.com:MoonHack2077/Weather-api.git`
Otherwise:
## `git clone https://github.com/MoonHack2077/Weather-api.git`

Second:
## `cd Weather-api`

Third:
## `npm i`

Fourth:
## `npm start`

### **To consider:**
In the making of this project i needed help of a google chrome extension named:  <a href='https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/%20Moesif%20Origin%20%26%20CORS%20Changer?hl=es&gclid=Cj0KCQjw6pOTBhCTARIsAHF23fJ0IJT9qdHF1TdV5yKGxkRWHRGwavdiR6zBK8QNqxGSMhURjhyxjJoaAksZEALw_wcB' > Moesif Origin & CORS Changer</a>, because I had problems with the 'cors' in the called to the API ,** as long as this point doesnÂ´t  be removed, i am going to accept suggestions to solve it. **
